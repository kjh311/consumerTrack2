2nd Attempt at Consumer Track coding Challenge:


NOTES FROM 1ST ATTEMPT:
-Nice use of HTML5 form validation

-Accurate representation of mockup

-Heavy use of ID selectors
	Changed all selectors to use class

-Loaded CSS out of order so he had to use !important entirely too much
	CSS in order using nested @include media-breakpoint-up(), instead of using media queries at the end. Don't use !important anymore.

-Barely used Bootstrap
	Tried to utilize Bootstrap Utility Classes as much as possible.


*BONUS, all working:
	•	Error handling on form validation for field types
	•	First Name - No Spaces and only letters
	•	DOB - At least 18 years old
	•	Email Address - Valid email
	•	Displaying a visual indication to the user of the error and message
