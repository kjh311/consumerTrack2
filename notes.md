2nd Attempt at Consumer Track coding Challenge:


NOTES FROM 1ST ATTEMPT:
-Nice use of HTML5 form validation

-Accurate representation of mockup

-Heavy use of ID selectors
	changed all selectors to class

-Loaded CSS out of order so he had to use !important entirely too much
	CSS in order using @include media-breakpoint-up()

-Barely used Bootstrap
	tried to utilize Bootstrap Utility Classes as much as possible.
